# MavenProject
Building a new Maven Project
This is a Maven Project written in Java 11 on Intellij, I have been following the Tim BuchalkaÂ´s tutorial "Java Spring Tutorial Masterclass- Learn Spring Framework 5 (Udemy)", 
In this Spring Tutorial is explained the Maven Lifecycle, the plugins and goals, as well how to set up the Logging with Logback (SLF4J previous verision). The application has got 
3 files, the java file, and two xml files, the pom.xml file and logback.xml file.
